Fiscal PolicyDefinition 
•Itrefers tothepolicy ofthegovernment asregards taxation, public
borrowing andpublic expenditure with specific objectives inview–to
produce desirable effects onthe national income, production,
employment andgeneral price level .Importance of Fiscal Policy
•Recognized during theGreat Depression of1930 sbyJohn Maynard Keynes .
•Prior tothat itwas believed thatgovernment’s activities should remain
restricted tothemaintenance oflaw and order and provision ofcertain
essential services totheeconomy .
•During Great Depression itwas realized that private sector onitsown
cannot initiate aprocess ofrecovery since the incentive toinvest was
simply notthere–hencegovernment’s role wasfeltnecessary .
•Keynes promoted therole ofthegovernment byrealizing that tosolve the
problem ofunemployment equilibrium, government must step in.
•Insituations ofinflation ordeflation thegovernment canstep intocontrol
thevolume ofexpenditure intheeconomy .Objectives of Fiscal Policy
•Increasing the rate ofinvestment –toincrease the rate ofinvestment, savings has tobe
increased .Savings canbeincreased byraising thegovernmental income through taxation and
public borrowing .
•Encouraging asocially optimum pattern ofinvestment –direct investments inthose fields that are
desirable from thepoint ofview ofthesociety .Indeveloping countries investments inrailway
tracks, telegraphs andtelephone systems, power plants, electricity generations andsometimes in
basic andcapital goods industries may besocially optimum .
•Reducing inequalities inincome–awelfare state committed tosocial equality and economic
justice will promote income equality .Inthis context fiscal policy becomes effective through
promotion ofaprogressive income taxstructure, heavy indirect taxes onluxury items and light
indirect taxes onmass consumption goods .Government canundertake programs onmedical care
ofthepoor, free education forpoor children, free housing forpoor landless laborers etc.
•Reducing unemployment –public expenditure can help totackle the problem through
construction ofschool buildings, hospital buildings, roads, earthen dams, irrigation canals etc.in
rural areas toreduce seasonal unemployment .InIndia -Cash Scheme forRural Employment,
Food forWork Programme ,National Rural Employment Programme ,Jawahar Rozgar Yojana ,
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme etc.
•Controlling inflationary tendencies –inorder toimplement large scale industrialization
programmes developing countries often have toresort todeficit financing .This may create
inflationary situations assupply ofgoods may failtoincrease inaccordance with theincrease in
demand .Inthiscontext fiscal policy canstep inbyreducing demand through increase intaxes or
encourage production through taxincentives toindustries .Sources of Public Revenue
•Taxation
•Public borrowingTaxation: Objectives
•Transferring resources from thehands ofthepublic tothehands ofthestate tomake possible public investment –
through taxation, requirements ofdevelopment canbemet.Buttheoptimum level oftaxation differs from country
tocountry depending onpreferences ofcitizens, administrative competence inthegovernment etc.
•Restraining orcurtailing consumption and thus transferring resources from consumption toinvestment –through
direct taxes thegovernment canreduce thedisposable income inthehands ofthepeople, thus restricting their
capacity tobuy goods .Through indirect taxes thegovernment can raise theprices ofgoods, thereby restricting
consumption .Iffunds raised through imposition oftaxes areloaned either totheprivate sector forcarrying out
investment orutilized directly bygovernment forbuilding uppublic enterprises ordeveloping social overhead
capital, theprocess ofcapital formation andeconomic development gets aboost .
•Increasing theincentive tosave andinvest–toencourage thehabit ofsavings, income taxconcessions aregenerally
granted onmoney saved .Similar concessions are also granted onsavings offirms and other institutions .To
encourage investment, taxrebates, taxholidays tobusiness enterprises areallowed intheinitial years oftheir
operations .
•Modify the pattern ofinvestment –encouraging investments indesirable areas through taxincentives and by
restricting investments inunproductive channels (speculative activities, investment inreal estates, land, property
etc.)through high levels oftaxation .Ifthegovernment feels that investment inbasic and capital goods industries is
necessary forpushing uptherate ofindustrialization, itcansetupthese industries inthepublic sector byutilizing
theresources obtained through taxation .
•Mitigating economic inequalities –redistributive government finance helps inimproving productivity and real
income ofpeople through human capital formation (programmes oneducation and training toreduce illiteracy and
increase skills leading toanincrease inthe quality ofmanpower) .Redistributive finance also reduces political
instability inunderdeveloped countries byhelping inreducing thegapbetween richandpoor .Types of Taxes
•Progressive taxes -when higher income families paynotonly larger
income taxes, butpayahigher fraction oftheir incomes intheform of
taxes compared tothepoor .
•Proportional taxes -alltaxpayers payexactly thesame proportion of
income .
•Regressive income taxes -poor payalarger fraction oftheir income in
taxes than therich.
•Direct taxes–theburden ofthetaxisborne bytheindividual on
whom thetaxisimposed .
•Indirect tax–theburden ofthetaxisborne byindividuals other than
onwhom thetaxisimposed .Use of Different Taxes in Generation of Resources
Personal income tax
•Itisadirect taxastheburden ofthetaxisborne bytheperson onwhom thetaxis
imposed .
•Developing countries depend onincome taxtoafarlesser extent than developed nations
because oftheinability topay(due tolow income) and also widespread taxevasions
(due toweaknesses ingeneral administration) .
•Less than 3%ofthethird world population pay income taxwhereas 60-80%ofthe
population ofdeveloped nation payincome taxes .
•Assessment oftheincomes ofavast majority ofthepeople living inrural areas isdifficult
duetonon reporting ofincome andalso non exchange ofentire output inthemarket for
money .
•However considerable scope forincome taxcollection from thewealthy minorities exist .
•Inunderdeveloped countries wealthy groups have enough political power toblock tax
measures that they consider threats totheir position .Corporate Income Tax
•Itisdirect taximposed ontheprofits ofcorporations andcompanies .
•Share ofcorporate income taxintotal revenue ismuch less indeveloping
nations than indeveloped nations because :(1)corporate sector isonly a
small part oftheeconomy ;(2)inorder toencourage corporate activities
thegovernments ofdeveloping countries offer wide range ofincentives to
thecompanies e.g.,depreciation allowance, taxrebates, capital investment
subsidies, exemption from taxes forsome initial years etc.;(3)governments
generally avoid taxing corporate sector heavily ashigh taxes discourage the
formation ofnew companies .
•Argument infavor ofcorporate taxes–itiseasier tocollect such taxes as
thenumber ofcompanies aresmall and they areeasily identifiable, so
easier tomaintain their accounts andtaxthem .
•Multinational firms arelarge and earn huge profits, sothey canbetaxed
heavily .But usually governments avoid doing that topromote foreign
investments .Property/ Wealth tax
•Itisadirect taximposed ontheproperty ofindividuals depending upon the
value oftheproperty .
•Property taxes canbeused tomop upresources from therich sections of
thesociety indeveloping countries where extreme inequalities inincome
andwealth exist .
•Favorable consequences –(1)revenue resources ofthegovernment are
likely toincrease considerably through heavy taxation onthevery rich
propertied minorities ;(2)such taxes donothave anyadverse effect onthe
incentives toinvest asthey arenotlevied onproductive activities ofthe
people ;(3)inequalities inincome canbebrought down through such taxes .
•They donotusually contribute much tothepublic revenue indeveloping
countries astheir share intotal taxrevenue islessthan 10%.
•Urban property aremore heavily taxed than rural properties (land) .The
rich landholders can exercise aneffective control over thegovernment .
Also there may bedifficulty ofmaking property assessments and keeping
them uptodate .Excise Duty
•Itisanindirect taximposed onthe manufacturer ofaproduct, who
recovers itfrom thewholesalers andretailers .
•Inmost developing countries itscontribution ismore than 40%ofthetotal
taxrevenue .
•Heavy dependence onexcise duty asasource ofrevenue isindicator ofthe
fact that thecountries have failed tomake their taxstructure sufficiently
progressive .
•Dependence onindirect taxes only increases theregressivity ofthetax
system asallpersons who consume the commodity must pay the tax
whether they arerichorpoor .
•Situation canbeaverted bytaxing luxury goods more .
•Taxing more luxury goods than goods ofmass consumption fails toproduce
thedesired result asluxury goods arehighly price elastic while goods of
mass consumption arehighly price inelastic .Sales Tax
•Itisanindirect taxastheliability topaythetaxisontheshopkeeper, who
claims itfrom thecustomers .
•Excise duty islevied onproduction, sales taxisusually levied atthepoint of
final sale ofthecommodity .
•Collected from allregistered trading concerns who invariably shift their
burden toconsumers .
•Inprinciple, sales tax can beintroduced atany ofthe 3stages–
manufacturing stage (Colombia, Ghana, Uganda etc.),wholesale stage
(Pakistan, Honduras) andretail stage (India) .
•Retail stage taxation ismost difficult toadminister since alarge number of
small traders are operating inthe economy and itisvery difficult to
maintain contacts with allofthem .Many ofthese small traders donot
have anyaccounting knowledge andareilliterate .
•Taxation atthewholesale stage isless difficult toadminister especially if
large wholesalers arecovered .Customs Duties
•Associated with foreign trade .
•Itisanindirect taximposed ontheimporter/ exporter ofaproduct, which isrecovered from the
retailers andcustomers .
•2types–export duty (imposed onexports) andimport duty (imposed onimports) .
•Fordeveloping countries import duties aremore important –reasons–(1)exports ofthese
countries are very low and difficult toincrease because ofunfavorable conditions inthe
international market andconsumer prejudices against goods ofdeveloping countries ;(2)inorder
toprotect domestic goods against foreign competition, imported goods have tobemade
expensive than domestic goods .
•Developing countries need toimport large scale capital goods fordevelopment butdue topoor
exports, areforced toimpose heavy duties onimport ofinessential consumer goods andluxuries .
•Import duties canbeof2types–specific (tax perunit ofthecommodity sold, notprice) and
advalorem (tax asapercentage ofthevalue ofthecommodity, hence dependent upon price) .
Specific duties areeasier toadminister butnotflexible .Advalorem import duties areflexible and
revenue from them increase with price .InIndia import duties are generally levied onan
advalorem basis .
•Import duties areeasier toadminister asgoods imported arelimited innumber and theports
through which they enter arealso limited .Thegoods arrive inbulk containers andcannot escape
detection .
•Similar arguments canbemade about export duties also.Butindeveloping countries thetrend is
export subsidies rather than export duties tomake theproducts competitive intheinternational
market .Expenditure Tax
•Itisadirect tax.
•Tax isimposed onthe actual expenditure (personal income less
savings) ofanindividual .
•Itdoes notaffect personal savings adversely asitisimposed onactual
expenditure ofanindividual .Against this, income taxhas more
adverse effect onpersonal savings andprogressive income taxislikely
toerode thecapacity tosave inaneconomy .
•Administrative cost ofexpenditure tax isheavy and difficult to
administer .
•India introduced expenditure taxin1957 onthebasis ofN.Kaldor’s
recommendation tocurtail conspicuous consumption .But didnot
work .Therefore thegovernment hadtoabandon it.Taxonagriculture
•Indeveloping countries, agriculture iseither taxfree orvery lightly taxed .Reason–
agriculture isthesubsistence sector oftheeconomy and istherefore notintheposition
tobear heavy taxburden .
•Argument istrue foralarge section ofthe rural population but not forthe large
landholders .Therefore failure totaxlarge landholders makes thetaxsystem inequitable
andunjust .
•Types ofagricultural tax–land taxation, agricultural income tax,taxation ofagricultural
produce etc.
•Land taxation istheoldest form ofagricultural tax–also known asland revenue –
difficult toadminister asindeveloping countries there isnoclearly defined pattern of
land ownership –most cultivators aretenants, having only rights tocultivate than own
land.
•Foragricultural income tax, the local authorities can form anestimate ofthe total
income and wealth ofthepeople living inanarea, with incomes below theexemption
limit ofaproper income tax,byconsidering crops, cattle, wages etc.
•Ifthegovernment canexercise effective control over themarketing system, itcanimpose
taxonagricultural produce–itcanpurchase thecrops from thefarmers atprices netof
taxand later collect theactual taxfrom thewholesalers orother intermediaries who
purchase thecrop from thegovernment –difficult toadminister .Goods and Services Tax (GST)
•Biggest reform inIndia’s indirect taxstructure since liberalization .
•Asingle point taxstructure with uniform rates willdoaway with thebusiness ofvariable state taxes for
most goods .
•Allcentral -and state -level taxes and levies onallgoods and services willbesubsumed within an
integrated taxhaving twocomponents :acentral GSTandastate GST.
•Central taxes that GST will replace–central excise duties, excise duty onmedicinal and toiletries
preparations, additional duty ofexcise ontextile and textile products, central sales tax, service tax,
additional duties ofcustoms, service tax,cess andsurcharges related tosupply ofgoods andservice .
•State taxes that GST will subsume –state VAT/ sales tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, entry tax,
entertainment tax,taxonadvertisements, taxonlotteries andgambling, state cess andsurcharges .
•OutofGST–alcoholic andpetroleum products .Each state cansetrates .
•Under GST there willbetaxonly onvalue addition ateach stage (e.g.,manufacturing, wholesale and
retail trade), with producer orseller atevery stage able tosetoffhistaxes against thecentral orstate
GSTpaid onhispurchases .
•The end consumer willonly bear theGST charged bythelastdealer inthesupply chain, with setoff
benefits atallprevious stages .
•Itwilldiscourage taxevasion .Problems in Raising Resources through Taxation
•There isalarge non-monetized sector indeveloping countries .Itisdifficult to
evaluate thereal income offarmers and other self employed people, and in
including thevalue ofhome produced andconsumed food inthetaxable income
offarmers .
•Illiterate population .Most ofthe farmers, wage earners, small shopkeepers,
craftsmen etc.,cannot even filloutthesimplest income taxreturn forms .
•Novoluntary compliance onthepart oftaxpayers .Large number ofbusinessmen
donotmaintain books properly .While fixed income groups (salaried class) pays
income taxregularly, alarge number ofprosperous businessmen evade taxes .
•Anonymity intheownership ofwealth–makes difficult totaxincome derived
from capital orwealth inaneffective way.
•Inagricultural sector, thelarge landholders areletoffandtherefore theburden of
taxfalls onthesmall monetized ormarket sector .
•Inefficient andcorrupt administration indeveloping countries .Public Borrowing
•Second most important source ofpublic revenue .
•Different from taxes asallborrowings must berepaid .
•Justified forconstruction ofroads, railways, canals, irrigation, installation ofpower plants, building ofschools,
hospital buildings etc.
•Financing ofsuch activities through government borrowing isbetter than through taxation astaxation will
place heavy burden onthepresent generation while thebenefits willaccrue toanumber ofgenerations .
•Government canraise public debt either intheform ofvoluntary loan orintheform ofcompulsory loan.
•Voluntary loan–raising resources byissuing various types ofbills andsecurities ifpublic expenditure exceeds
public income -difficult indeveloping countries with lowincome levels .
•Compulsory Loans–more often indeveloping countries –frequently imposed atthetime ofinflation–bonds
canbeissued forperiods ranging from 5to10years with taxfree interest payment –Employees Provident
Fund (EPF) orNational Pension Scheme (NPS) .
•External loans–gapbetween foreign exchange payments andreceipts often filled upbyforeign borrowings .
•Disadvantages offoreign loans–(1)reduce thefreedom ofthereceiver country topurchase inthecheapest
market ;(2)receiver country often forced tobuyseveral inessential goods asapart of‘package deal’ ;(3)often
foreign loans areproject tied sonofreedom tousethem foranyother purpose ;(4)often issued inanyear to
year basis producing uncertainty ;(5)receiver country may notfollow independent policies asthere isalotof
political pressure from thedonor nations ororganizations .Public Expenditure
•Government can increase the level ofinvestment through creation ofvarious public works
program .
•Projects necessary forindustrialization likelaying railway tracks, power generation, development
communication etc.arenottaken uptheprivate sector asinvestment isheavy butreturns arelow
andrealized only after long intervals .Similarly forbasic andcapital goods industries .
•Government steps in,butitrequires massive expansion inpublic expenditure .
•This initial expenditure bythegovernment helps inbuilding upoftheenvironment conducive for
thedevelopment oftheprivate sector .
•The government also hastoensure increase inagricultural production and productivity tomeet
therequirement ofindustrial sector forrawmaterials .
•Increased public expenditure due provision ofcheap housing facilities, cheap orfree health
service, education etc.–they improve thelevel ofproductivity inthelong runandhelp inbuilding
amore egalitarian society .
•Expenditure forpublic distribution system–new fairprice shops have tobeopened, storage and
warehousing facilities have tobeprovided .
•Expenditure forreducing regional inequalities through industrial location policy–various
subsidies andincentive areprovided tosetupindustries inbackward regions .Deficit Financing
•Importance feltduring theGreat Depression of1930 s.
•The actofunbalancing ofbudget sothat government expenditure
exceeding government revenue, cansettheeconomy onthepath to
economic recovery .
•Deficit financing refers tothemethods offinancing thebudgetary gap.
•Indeveloped countries thegovernment borrows from thebanks by
selling securities which leads toactivation ofidledeposits ofindividuals
held bythebanks .Total money supply increases asaresult .
•Indeveloping countries, the government borrows from the central
bank .The central bank merely prints more money sothat money
supply increases .Deficit Financing in Developed Countries
•Deficit financing indeveloped countries advocated during thephase of
depression when there ischronic deficiency inprivate demand leading toa
sharp fallinthe level ofexpenditure ofthe economy –goods remain
unsold–capital equipment andmachinery remain idle–banks andgeneral
public prefer nottoundertake theriskofinvestment and accumulate idle
cash .
•Insuch circumstances thegovernment canpush upitsexpenditure through
deficit spending onpublic works (building roads, bridges etc.),which will
create employment opportunities, leading toincrease inpurchasing power
ofpeople .
•The increase indemand willpush upproductive activities intheeconomy
(more private investments), creating more employment and income, and
helping theeconomy tocome outofdepression .
•How effective themethod willbe,willdepend upon theresponsiveness of
private expenditure .Deficit Financing in Developing Countries
•Indeveloping countries level ofvoluntary savings plus resources raised bythe
government intheform oftaxes, public borrowings andexternal finance aremuch less
compared totheneeds ofinvestments .
•This gap has tobefilled through deficit financing, hence ithelps inpromoting
economic development indeveloping countries .
•Creation ofnew money through deficit financing leads toinflation due todeficient
resources forproduction (factory buildings, machineries etc.).
•Inflationary situation may notarise indeveloped countries asresources forproduction
arepresent butdemand isdeficient –iftheavailable resources aresufficient tocater
toincreased demand duetodeficit financing, inflation willnotoccur .
•Indeveloping countries increase inincome through increase inmoney supply will
result inincrease inconsumption offood items .Since supply offood may notincrease
asfastastheincrease indemand, theprices willincrease .
•Resources raised through deficit financing arerarely spent onconsumption goods
(through programs such asdistribution ofhigh yielding variety seeds, fertilizers etc.to
farmers) and more onbuilding costly capital equipment (e.g.,laying railway tracks,
improved communication facilities, hydro electricity generation etc.).Hence food
inflation iscommon .Cases for Inflationary Method of Financing
•According tosome economic growth must beaccompanied byinflation .
•Inflations leads toatransfer ofincome from wage earners toagroup of
profit earners .Ifprices rose faster than wages andpropensity tosave out
ofprofits ishigher than thepropensity tosave outofwages, savings and
investment willincrease leading toanincrease ineconomic growth .Deficit Financing or Taxation in Developing Countries?
•Deficit financing leads toinflation and many ofthe developing
countries arecurrently reeling under theinflationary pressure .
•Many developing countries arenotefficient enough tocome outof
theinflationary pressure once itsets in.
•Hence taxation more favorable .Budget Deficit
•Budget deficit istheexcess oftotal expenditure (including both revenue
andcapital) over total receipts (including both revenue andcapital) .
•Capital expenditure/ receipts areassociated with thepurchase orsale of
fixed assets that areexpected tobeproductive over along period oftime .
•Revenue expenditure/ receipts areassociated with day-to-day activities,
such ascost ofgoods sold orpurchased, repairs andmaintenance expenses
etc.
•There canbe3different types ofdeficits inthebudget depending upon the
types ofreceipts andexpenditures taken into account–(1)revenue deficit ;
(2)fiscal deficit ;(3)primary deficit .Revenue Deficit
•Revenue Deficit =Total Revenue Expenditure –Total Revenue
Receipts
•Revenue deficit isassociated with the current expenditure and
current receipts ofthegovernment .
•Thegovernment hastoborrow tofinance itsexpenditure .
•Ahigher revenue deficit implies higher repayment burden infuture .
•The government should try tocurtail itshigher consumption
expenditure .
•Thegovernment canraise taxes onrich and impose new taxes where
possible tomeet thedeficit .Fiscal Deficit
•Fiscal deficit =total expenditure (revenue and capital)–total receipts (revenue and
capital) excluding borrowings
•Itisameasure ofhow much thegovernment needs toborrow from themarket tomeet
itsexpenditure when itsresources areinadequate .
•Fiscal deficit iszero ifweaddborrowings tototal receipts .
•Borrowings include notonly theamount ofaccumulated debt (i.e.,theamount ofthe
loan) butalso theinterest onanyprevious loan.
•There canbefiscal deficit without revenue deficit–(1)when revenue budget isbalanced
butcapital budget isindeficit ;(2)when revenue budget isinsurplus, butdeficit inthe
capital budget isgreater than thesurplus inrevenue budget .
•Fiscal deficit isadvantageous ifitcreates new capital assets toincrease productive
capacity oftheeconomy .Itisdetrimental ifused tocover revenue deficits only.
•Methods tofinance fiscal deficit–(1)borrowing from thepublic and commercial banks
bytaking money from provident fund and small savings schemes ;(2)borrowing from
external sources likeIMF, World Bank ;(3)deficit financing .
•Taxbase should bebroadened and concessions and reductions intaxes should beruled
outtoreduce fiscal deficit .Areduction inexpenditure onmajor subsidies, bonus, LTCs
etc.may also help.Primary Deficit
•Primary deficit =fiscal deficit ofcurrent year–interest payments on
previous borrowings .
•Itshows how much thegovernment isborrowing tomeet expenses other
than interest payments .
•Primary deficit excludes theburden oftheprevious debt and only shows
thenetincrease inthegovernment’s debt that isduetothecurrent fiscal .
•Ifprimary deficit iszero, then fiscal deficit isequal tointerest payments .It
implies thegovernment has toborrow tofinance theinterest payment
only.
•Areduction inprimary deficit means that the government ismaking
attempts toreduce itsexcess expenditure .

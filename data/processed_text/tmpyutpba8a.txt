**1. Executive Summary:**  
 
In Q2 2024, Finverge Technologies achieved a quarter -over -quarter (QoQ) revenue growth of 
22.8%, driven by increased enterprise subscriptions and onboarding of two large retail clients 
(ReliantMart and ShopSphere).  
 
While revenue  showed strong performance, cash burn increased due to product R&D expansion 
and higher customer acquisition costs (CAC). The company is on track to reach breakeven by 
Q1 2025, pending successful closure of the current bridge round.
